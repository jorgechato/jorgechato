How to work with me?

# Preferred Workflow

My ideal day involves structured focus in the morning, with a bit more flexibility in the afternoon. I thrive with enough context and autonomy to approach challenges with my own methods while aligning with team and project goals.

# Team Interaction

- **Async Communication**: I prefer messaging that respects my focus times and encourages a healthy work rhythm.
- **Casual Conversations**: I enjoy team connections on light-hearted topics during non-focus times; it adds to a collaborative environment.

# Feedback Style

- **Giving Feedback**: I like structured, anonymous feedback loops (e.g., 360 reviews) but am also open to direct feedback if I know the team member well or they request it.
- **Receiving Feedback**: Direct, constructive, and private feedback works best for me. If something needs adjusting, feel free to reach out to me individually.

# Handling Stress

I prioritize a low-stress environment for a happy and productive life. When stress does arise, I handle it with focus and efficiency. If high stress persists over a long period, I evaluate the situation and look for adjustments to restore balance and productivity.

# Conflict Resolution

I’m a firm believer in communication. If there’s a conflict, I clarify each point of view until we’re all on the same page.

# What I Value

Challenge is a key motivator—whether it's a new language, coding style, or framework. I value room for growth and opportunities to learn while contributing to meaningful projects.

# Daily Logistics

- **Work Location**: I prefer remote work but am open to in-person meetings if needed for specific projects or team events. You can even track my current location in [Where is Jorge Today?](https://whereisjorge.today/).
- **Communication**: Slack is ideal for minor or async questions. If my response is delayed, I may be focused on a priority task. Feel free to ping me again if your request is urgent and include a priority level. Please avoid messages like "Hello" without context—I might forget to follow up without details!
- **Meetings**: Short, 30-minute Google Meet calls are best for project alignment or urgent discussions.

# How I Can Help You

I’m enthusiastic about problem-solving across topics like coding (any language), pipelines, and finance. I also love discussing code structure and architecture, so feel free to loop me into those conversations.

# How You Can Help Me

- **Clear Deadlines**: I tend to dive deep in research; longer but specific deadlines help me stay focused.
- **Dependency Timelines**: Realistic estimates (+20%) are super helpful for alignment.
- **Direct Feedback**: Constructive feedback is always welcome. An individual ping with suggestions goes a long way.
